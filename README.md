# The-Infinite-Hotel
There is an infinite hotel with an infinite number of rooms. All of the rooms are full, and a new guest arrives. How can the hotel accommodate the new guest?

Solution:

The hotel can accommodate the new guest by moving the guest in room 1 to room 2, the guest in room 2 to room 3, and so on. This will create an empty room for the new guest.
